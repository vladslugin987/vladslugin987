## 🚀 About Me

I've been passionate about programming for as long as I can remember. My journey began back in 2014 when I created my first simple website using HTML and CSS. Since then, I've participated in programming competitions and worked as a freelancer during my school years, building websites.

My interests don't stop at web development. In my quest for knowledge, I've also delved into creating exploits and finding vulnerabilities in computer games for scientific purposes.
